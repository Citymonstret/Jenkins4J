/**
 * Java representations of Jenkins elements
 * <p>
 * There are two types of objects that you will encounter when working with Jenkins4J:
 * <ul>
 * <li>description classes</li>
 * <li>information classes</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * A description is a simple member of an info class, and it will often just contain a name or a number.
 * You can use a description to get a ({@link java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture} of) an
 * information class. Information classes contain references to child nodes, and a bunch of meta
 * data. This is to mirror how the Jenkins API works.
 * <p>
 * You can use description classes to retrieve their corresponding information classes, by using
 * {@link org.incendo.jenkins.objects.NodeChild#getParent()}.
 * All information classes can also be retrieved using the Jenkins instance.
